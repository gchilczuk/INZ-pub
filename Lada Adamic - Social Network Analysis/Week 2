2B - random graphs and alternative models


Edros-Renyi - simplest network model
	nodes connect at random
	network is undirected

	there is no hubs in such network

	parameters:
		N - number of nodes
		p - probability that any two nodes are connected
		M - total number of edges

	Degree distribution
		how many nodes in the netwrk have no neighbours, how many have 1 neighbour, how many 2, etc
		what is the probability that a node has 0, 1, 2, 3, … edges?


		each node has (N-1) tries to get edges
		each try is a success with probability p
		the binomial distribution gives us the probability that na node has degree k

		B(N-1; k; p) = ((N-1) [symbol Newtona] k) * (p^k) * ((1-p)^(N-1-k))



		choosing k items out of (n-1)
			(n-1)! / (k! * (n-1-k)!)

	
	z - average number of friends
	friends at distance l = z^l

	average shortest path = log N / log z

	Edros-Renyi network can grow to be vary large but nodes will be just few hops apart

Introduction model
	prob-link - p - probability of connection of any to nodes (like in ER)
	prob-intro - probability that the other node is selected amoing one of our friends' friends (not completely at random)

	relative to ER:
		· more edges
		· more closed triads (trójkącik z trzech nodów)
		· longer average shortest path
		· different degree distribution (more uneven degree)
		· size of the giant component (smaller at low p)


Static Geografical model
	nodes have some position
	it infulence probability of connections

Random encouter
	like static geografical model
	but it's not static
	nodes are moving around - if thet bump each other they create connection


Growth model
	instead of starting with fixed number of nodes they are added over time



sum-up
	in some instances ther ER is plausible (prawdopodobny)
	if dynamics are different, ER model may be a poor fit
